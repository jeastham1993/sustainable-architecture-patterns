# Sustainable Archietcture Patterns

Example implementations of software architecture patterns centered around building sustainable architectures. For more information on sustinable architecture, check out [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uGQD3qle4k).

All patterns covered also have a corresponding video on my YouTube channel, all covered in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uGQD3qle4k&list=PLCOG9xkUD90JJnwqM24E_16Xn-qWI7Hbw).

Initially, all examples are written in .NET. Over time, examples will be provided in other runtimes as well.
